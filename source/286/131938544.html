  <h1 itemprop=name>rosen’s dignity and schopenhauer</h1>
</header>

<p>michael rosen is professor of govern&shy;ment at harvard university.<sup><a href=#434068>1</a></sup> his book <i>dignity</i><sup><a href=#290700>2</a></sup> liter&shy;ally opens with schopen&shy;hauer:

<blockquote>
  <p>schopenhauer, the ebenezer scrooge of nine&shy;teenth-century philo&shy;sophy, took a&nbsp;character&shy;istically jaundiced view of talk of human dignity: <q>that expression, <i>dignity of man</i>, once uttered by kant, after&shy;ward became the shibbo&shy;leth of all per&shy;plexed and empty-headed moralists who concealed behind that imposing expression their lack of any real basis of morals, or, at any rate, of one that had any mean&shy;ing. they cunningly counted on the fact that their readers would be glad to see them&shy;selves invested with such a&nbsp;<i>dignity</i> and would accord&shy;ingly be quite satisfied with it.</q><sup><a href=#979379>3</a></sup> is schopen&shy;hauer right? is the talk of <q>dignity</q> mere hum&shy;bug&nbsp;— a&nbsp;pomp&shy;ous facade, flattering to our self-esteem but with&shy;out any genuine sub&shy;stance behind it?<sup><a href=#198006>2.1</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>why does rosen attack schopen&shy;hauer personally?

<blockquote>
  <p>schopenhauer’s criticism is troubling when we think how im&shy;portant the word <q>dignity</q> has become in con&shy;temporary polit&shy;ical and ethical discussion.<sup><a href=#198006>2.1</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>rosen is so afraid of being found out that he even entitles the first chapter with schopen&shy;hauer’s words: <q>the shibboleth of all empty-headed moralists</q>.

<p>he counts ruth macklin, james griffin, and joel fein&shy;berg among the few con&shy;temporary dignity deniers like schopen&shy;hauer.<sup><a href=#863487>2.2</a></sup>

<p>rosen jumps back into the nine&shy;teenth century:

<blockquote>
  <p>although i think that schopen&shy;hauer exagge&shy;rates how far the nine&shy;teenth-century idea of human dignity derived from kant, it seems plaus&shy;ible to think that, by the time that he was writ&shy;ing (1839), the various strands of <q>human dignity</q> had in&shy;deed be&shy;come fused into a&nbsp;cliche of pious humanit&shy;arianism. nor is it sur&shy;prising to find <q>dignity</q> opposed by liberal&shy;ism’s con&shy;temporary critics. it was not just schopen&shy;hauer who re&shy;acted against the pervasive&shy;ness of appeals to human dignity.<sup><a href=#182884>2.3</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>at the end of the book rosen finally discloses his own meaning of dignity:

<blockquote>
  <p>one of the key ways in which human dignity is violated is by pre&shy;venting human beings from behaving in ways that are dignified.<sup><a href=#770080>2.4</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>this indeed sounds like an echo in an empty head. schopen&shy;hauer is right.
